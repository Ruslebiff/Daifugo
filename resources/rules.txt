Game Rules
• A game can have 3-8 players

• The game is played with a regular 52-card deck, divided randomly as
evenly as possible among the players to form their hands.

• The game is trick-based and a round is over when only a single player
has cards left in hand. A game can have an arbitrary number of rounds.

• The game has five roles:
– President
∗ The player who emptied their hand first in the previous round
– Vice president (4+ players only)
∗ The player who emptied their hand second in the previous
round
– Vice-bum (4+ players only)
∗ The player who emptied their hand next to last in the previous round
– Bum
∗ The player who emptied their hand last in the previoius round
– Neutral
∗ All other players

• In the initial round the player with the card 3 of diamonds in their hand
starts the game, and play proceeds clockwise (or simply in a ranomly
decided player order, since the game is virtual). In following rounds
the sitting bum will, after trading cards with the president, play first
and play will proceed in the same order.

• After cards are dealt in subsequent rounds, presidents will trade cards
with bums.
– In a 3-player game the bum must give their very best card (except
the 3 of clubs) to the president, and the president gives a card in
return, however they may choose any card they wish.
– In games with 4 or more players, the president and bum will
exchange 2 cards with eachother in the same fashion as in a 3-
player game, and the vice-president and vice-bum will exchange
a single card like the president and bum does in a 3-player game.

• Card values, suits add no value to a card:
– 2 – second highest card
– Ace, King, Queen . . . 3
– 3 of clubs is a special card that can wipe out whatever combination
of cards that are on the table, however if this is the last card on
your hand – you lose.

• Tricks
– A round is played through several tricks
– In the beginning of a round, the table is empty, and the starting
plaer is free to play 1-4 cards of the same value. Players must
match the number of cards, and play a value equal or higher than
the top card on the table, until the trick is scored. If unable to
do so, a player must pass, and can not play any cards until the
current trick is over.
∗ The exception to this is 3 of clubs, which can be played on
anything to win a trick.
– A trick is primarily scored when all other players pass after you
have played your cards. The cards on the table are removed and
you are free to play any number of cards, starting a new trick.
But a trick may also be scored if:
∗ After playing your card(s), the top 4 cards on the table have
the same value
∗ You play the 3 of clubs
– If the player winning a trick has no cards left, the next player in
order who is still part of the round is free to play.
